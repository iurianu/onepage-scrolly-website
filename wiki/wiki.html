						<p itemprop="description">Aya Ueto was born in Nerima, Tokyo to a Hokkaidan father and an Okinawan mother.[6] Her parents divorced shortly after Ueto's debut. She is the middle of three children with an older brother, Shun, and younger brother Makoto.[6] Despite growing up in a relatively poor household, Ueto studied piano, modern ballet, swimming and gymnastics. She originally had no ambitions to become an entertainer; she instead wanted to become a pre-school teacher.[1]</p>
						<p itemprop="description">After hearing about one of her friends' experience as an extra on a TV drama, she decided she too "wanted to appear on TV."[6] Unbeknownst to her daughter, Ueto's mother entered her into the 7th Japan Bishōjo Contest.[6] When she was twelve years old, Ueto won the special jury prize at the contest.[1] She revealed later on that her real motivation for doing well was to "win the two million yen cash prize to buy a house for her family," however because what she won was an ad hoc prize decided that day, there was no monetary reward.[7] After Ueto's discovery, she joined the talent agency Oscar Promotion and began acting and singing lessons. In July 1998, Ueto joined the idol group Z-1. The group landed a regular spot on the variety shows Kaishingeki TV! Utaemon and The Yoru mo Hippare, and debuted on Toshiba EMI a year later with the single "Vibe!" In 1999, Ueto obtained her first role in the film Satsujinsha: Killer of Paraiso, in which her lines were entirely in English.</p>
